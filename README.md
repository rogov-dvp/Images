# Mini-Porject 3

## Overview

This README covers the design choices, instructions to run the code, and sample outputs for both parts of this mini-project.

The first part is to replicate a Memory Management in C using only bitwise operations.

The second part is to replicate a file system in C using only bitwise operations.

## Part 1 (Memory_Management)

### Design choices



### How to run

Type the following to have the code run:

```cd Memory_Management``` Navigate to the memory management folder

```gcc memory_manager.c``` Compile the c code into an executable file

If on Windows:
```./a.exe input_memory.c``` An executable file will be created. Takes in the data filepath location that conatins the data input file.

If on UNIX:
```./a.out input_memory.c``` An OUT file will be created. Takes in the data filepath location that contains the data input file.

### Sample Output
